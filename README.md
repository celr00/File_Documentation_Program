# File_Documentation_Program
 Program that reads a other C++ programs and creates an HTML document with the documentarion.
 
 For this we will need to add the following tags to the program you want to document.
  - @progName
  - @author
  - @date
  - @funcName
  - @desc
  - @param
  - @return
 These tags must be inside of a long comment (/**/). The first line will iniciate the comment but have nothing else, the last line will only end the comment.
 
 Example:
 /*
  @progName Factorial
  @desc Programa that has a function that calculates the factorial of a number
  @author Carlos Lozada
  @date Jan 5th, 2021
 */
